#### Hi! I’m Ferran Pons and I'm specialized in Kotlin Multiplatform


Senior Android Developer working for some of the most popular brands in Spain. With almost 20 years of experience as a programmer, my experience covers a lot of different kinds of applications, from web app development to desktop, mobile apps, and videogames. I’ve worked two years at Electronic Arts as an Integration Engineer, participating in some blockbuster games such as Burnout Paradise, DeadSpace, and the Skate franchise. Also, I started up my own indie videogame studio, labeled “Retrowax Games” with which I’ve made a game called Zombusters that was published for the Xbox360, Windows Phone, and PC (Steam, Itch.io).
